# Production Problem 07: Implementing HCI guidelines for touchscreens

## The Problem

Using the HCI guidelines from either Apple/iOS, GNOME, or Windows, redesign the login page at
http://my.iit.edu/ for a touch-friendly environment. Use this to kickstart your work on Project 2.

**You only need to sketch your redesign**, and in the text below, reference at least three different
points of guidance from chosen HCI guidelines that went into your redesign sketches (you might
want to do multiple sketches, each highlighting a different feature of the same overall design).

## Resources

* Apple iOS HCI Guidlines:
  https://developer.apple.com/ios/human-interface-guidelines/overview/design-principles/
* Gnome Desktop:
  https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/desktop/design
* Windows Desktop Guidelines:
  https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/desktop/design

## Deliverables

Small commits to your Production Problems repository that include:

1) photographs of sketches of your new design, from your sketchbook
2) an explanation of three different points of guidance from your chosen guidelines (point to the
   specific URL where the guidance can be found) that you implemented in your sketch, written below:

* HCI Guidline One (URL): 
  https://developer.apple.com/ios/human-interface-guidelines/graphics/custom-icons/
  
* How you implemented it in your sketch:

  I placed some icons in the username and passwsord fields. A small picture of a person, for the username to make the relation with the username field, and the password field has an icon of a password with hidden characters. The login icon has the checkmark to give the "finish or complete" look.
 

* HCI Guidline Two (URL):
  https://developer.apple.com/ios/human-interface-guidelines/ui-bars/search-bars/
  
* How you implemented it in your sketch:

  I added in a search icon for when the user wants to search for something specifc. Such as help, would yield results such as IIT alert, forgot password, etc. 

* HCI Guidline Three (URL):
  https://developer.apple.com/ios/human-interface-guidelines/interaction/loading/

* How you implemented it in your sketch:
  
  When the user clicks on the login button, the button will then display a loading icon validating the credentials. Once the credentials are validated, it will say success or display a check mark as an icon.
